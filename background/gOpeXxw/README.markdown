## Directory structure
I just uploaded the folder that I downloaded with [CodePen's export .zip function](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/#export-zip-1).
<details>
 <summary>src directory</summary>
 The content of the html file contains only the code described in the CodePen HTML panel. The same applies to css file and js file. So, for example, the html file does not contain a <code>head</code> tag or <code>link</code> tags.
</details>
<details>
 <summary>dist directory</summary>
 Download the entire contents of the dist directory, open <code>index.html</code> in a browser and you should see my snippet (hard to explain).
</details>

## CSS Variables
 - `--bg`: Footprint background color
 - `--fp-color`: Footprint color
 - `--fp-size`: The size of the margin between footprints. If you change this value, you must also change the value of `--fp-small-pY`.
 - `--fp-big-r`: Radius of lower circle
 - `--fp-big-pY`: Position of the lower circle in the Y-axis direction
 - `--fp-small-pY`: Position of the upper left circle and the upper right circle in the Y-axis direction
 - `--fp-mBS`: The margin between the upper and lower circles. It is easy to change this value by removing the comment out in the background-image property.
 - `--fp-mSS`: The margin between the lower circles.
