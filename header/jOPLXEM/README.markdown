## Directory structure
I just uploaded the folder that I downloaded with [CodePen's export .zip function](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/#export-zip-1).
<details>
 <summary>src directory</summary>
 The content of the html file contains only the code described in the CodePen HTML panel. The same applies to css file and js file. So, for example, the html file does not contain a <code>head</code> tag or <code>link</code> tags.
</details>
<details>
 <summary>dist directory</summary>
 Download the entire contents of the dist directory, open <code>index.html</code> in a browser and you should see my snippet (hard to explain).
</details>

## Features
 - Press `Tab` to focus on the hamburger icon and press `Enter` to open the menu
 - Automatically focus on search box when menu opens
 - While the menu is open, its background elements do not receive focus and are not read by assistive technology
 - Elements that mask menu background elements do not receive focus and cannot be read by assistive technology
