## Directory structure
I just uploaded the folder that I downloaded with [CodePen's export.zip function](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/#export-zip-1).
<details>
 <summary>src directory</summary>
 The content of the html file contains only the code described in the CodePen HTML panel. The same applies to css file and js file. So, for example, the html file does not contain a `head` tag or a `link` tag.
</details>
<details>
 <summary>dist directory</summary>
 if you open `index.html`, you should see the product I created with CodePen.
</details>

## Features
 
 - Change focus of title with `tab` key
 - The background color of the focused title changes slightly
 - Open panel with not only click but also `enter` key (with animation)
 - Elements in panel are focused only when panel is opened

## Code
The code to realize the shadow of the neumorphism style is based on [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/dev_loop/pen/XWJeKNO).

The accordion menu design is based on [Algolia's design](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/).
