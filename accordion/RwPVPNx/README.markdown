## File organization
I just uploaded the folder that I downloaded with [CodePen's export.zip function](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/#export-zip-1). The content of the html file in the `src` directory contains only the code described in the CodePen HTML panel. The same applies to css files and js files. So, for example, the html file does not contain a `head` tag or a `link` tag. On the other hand, if you open `index.html` in the `dist` directory with a browser, you should see the product I created with CodePen.

## Features
 
 - Change focus of title with `tab` key
 - The background color of the focused title changes slightly
 - Open panel with not only click but also `enter` key (with animation)
 - Elements in panel are focused only when panel is opened

## Code
The code to realize the shadow of the neumorphism style is based on [this CodePen](https://codepen.io/dev_loop/pen/XWJeKNO).

The accordion menu design is based on [Algolia's design](https://www.algolia.com/pricing/).
