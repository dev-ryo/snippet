## Directory structure
I just uploaded the folder that I downloaded with [CodePen's export .zip function](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/#export-zip-1).
<details>
 <summary>src directory</summary>
 The content of the html file contains only the code described in the CodePen HTML panel. The same applies to css file and js file. So, for example, the html file does not contain a <code>head</code> tag or <code>link</code> tags.
</details>
<details>
 <summary>dist directory</summary>
 Download the entire contents of the dist directory, open <code>index.html</code> in a browser and you should see my snippet (hard to explain).
</details>

## Features
 - Use the `Tab` key to focus and press `Enter` to open the search box
 - Opening the search box automatically focuses on the input field
 - While the search box is open, the background element does not receive focus
 - Close search box by pressing cross button or pressing `Esc` key
