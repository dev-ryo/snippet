# I create simple, beautiful and easy-to-use web parts.

## Purpose
I want you to do a code review. My knowledge may be wrong. My knowledge may be old. There may be something wrong with my code. There may be room for improvement. I'm glad if you support me with the experience and knowledge of everyone who works at the forefront of web production.

## Policy
I write the code considering the following points.
 - performance
 - Ease of use for users
 - Lightweight
 - Accessibility
 - Eliminate waste

## Other
I am not good at English. I am translating my native language (Japanese) into English using Google Translate. I'm sorry if the text is hard to read.
