## Directory structure
I just uploaded the folder that I downloaded with [CodePen's export .zip function](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/features/exporting-pens/#export-zip-1).
<details>
 <summary>src directory</summary>
 The content of the html file contains only the code described in the CodePen HTML panel. The same applies to css file and js file. So, for example, the html file does not contain a <code>head</code> tag or <code>link</code> tags.
</details>
<details>
 <summary>dist directory</summary>
 Download the entire contents of the dist directory, open <code>index.html</code> in a browser and you should see my snippet (hard to explain).
</details>

## Features
No icons or SVG elements are used. All you need is one `a` element (other elements are OK). The arrow line was created using the `background` property `linear-gradient`.

## CSS variables
 - `--bdc` : Border color
 - `--bdw` : Border width
 - `--bg` : Arrow background color
 - `--p` : The margin from the end of the element to the arrow
 - `--w` : Element width
